A Jamstack brochure style website built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (React) and a Headless CMS ([Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/)) for a friend's startup.

Styled with CSS-in-JS ([styled-components](https://styled-components.com/)) All content of the site is managed by the CMS and a REST endpoint ([Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)) was used to collect contact form submissions.

A serverless function ([Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions)) sends email notifications to owners of the site after receiving a form.

_Note: This is still a work in progress_
